# Tissue-specific genetic variation suggests distinct molecular pathways between body shape phenotypes and colorectal cancer

This repository contains the codes to perform the analyses included in our manuscript entitled "Tissue-specific genetic variation suggests distinct molecular pathways between body shape phenotypes and colorectal cancer".
There, we investigated the associations between Body Shape Phenotypes and Colorectal Cancer risk performing observational and Mendelian Randomization approaches. Body Shape Phenotypes are a complex and novel way to describe adiposity and are based on a Principal Component Analysis on 6 different anthropometric traits (weight, height, body mass index, waist and hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio).

Several analyses have been performed to further explore the biological bases of 4 different Body Shape Phenotypes and their association with colorectal cancer risk:
  1. Computing the Principal Component Analysis on 6 different anthropometric traits to obtain the Body Shape Phenotypes (available in Body_shapes.R).
  2. Observational analyses to assess the association between each Body Shape Phenotype and Colorectal Cancer risk (available in Observational.R).
  3. Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) on the Body Shape Phenotypes using BOLT-LMM (available in GWAS.sh).
  4. Association analyses using Mendelian Randomization (available in MR.R) to triangulate the evidence obtained in the observational analyses.
  5. Tissue-specific Mendelian randomization analyses (adapting the code available in MR.R).

Link to the manuscript will be available soon.
