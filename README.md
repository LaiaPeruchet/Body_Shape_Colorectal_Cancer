# Tissue-specific genetic variation suggests distinct molecular pathways between body shape phenotypes and colorectal cancer

This repository contains the codes to performe the analyses included in our manuscript entitled Tissue-specific genetic variation suggests distinct molecular pathways between body shape phenotypes and colorectal cancer.
There, we investigated the associations on Body Shape Phenotypes and Colorectal Cancer risk on observational and Mendelian randomization framework.

Several analyses have been performed to achieve this prupose including:
  1. Computing a Principal Component Analysis on 6 different anthropometric traits (weight, height, body mass index, waist and hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio). This is described in Body_shapes.R.
  2. Association analyses using observational (available in Observational.R) and Mendelian Randomization (available in MR.R) frameworks.
  3. Tissue-specific Mendelian randomization analyses (adapting the code available in MR.R).

Link to the manuscript will be available soon.
